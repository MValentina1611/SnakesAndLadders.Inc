# Snakes And Ladders
This program is a version of the famous snakes and ladders game.<br>
The game consists in that a number of players begin their journey across the board in square 1, moving in turn a number of squares equal to that shown by the dice thrown at that moment for that player. Players move in the same order that the squares are numbered. At the end, the player who reaches the square numbered with the highest number first wins.<br> 
The game is developed using recursive methods for all required repetitions. The data structure implemented throughout the development of the program are linked lists, the only exception is the array used to read the data entered by the user.
